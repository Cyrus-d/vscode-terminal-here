# vscode-terminal-here

Exposes the command `terminalHere.create` that creates a terminal at the directory of the current file. This can be accessed through the command palette (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) or by attaching a [custom keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings) to it.
